<h2 class="mb-4">About The Band</h2>
<p class="lead">The Band Project is an electronic rock band formed in 2020, known for their fusion of synthwave and alternative rock.</p>
<p>“The reason this story is important to a successful band program is that everyone must contribute for us to reach our goal.  We can’t have people waiting around for everyone else to do the work.

    You must do the work.
    You must take your instrument home.
    You must practice.
    You must ask for help if you need it.
    You must learn your part.
    You must come prepared to rehearsal.
    You must be on time.
    You must pay attention.
    You must have a good attitude.
    You must work.  You.
    
    Not just the first chair player.  Or the second chair player.  You.
    Not the person sitting to your right or your left.  You.
    Not someone on the other side of this room.  You.
    Not even this person on the podium.  I can't do it for you.
    
    You have to want it.
    You have to work for it.
    You have to earn it.
    
    No Work. No Reward.
